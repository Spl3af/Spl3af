  <summary><large>🧭 My Stand on Hacking & Ethics</large></summary>
  <br>
I love the hacker aesthetic-the terminal glow, the raw creativity, the elegance of bending systems to your will. But I could never become a hacker in the traditional sense.

It’s not about skill. It’s about impact.

I know what it feels like to be on the receiving end of digital fear. A sudden pop-up. A suspected virus. That sinking feeling in your gut. I would never want to be the cause of that in someone else.

My mission is to build tools that soothe, not scare.  
To debug with empathy.  
To protect peace of mind, even in the most chaotic systems.

I believe ethical software isn’t just about clean code—it’s about emotional safety.
